# Machine learning algorithms applied to public datasets

1. Cross Validation
- `cv.ipynb` illustrates different methods for cross-validation

2. Time series forcasting with XGBoost
- In `ts_forcasting.ipynb` I work on an energy dataset to predict energy consumption with python using time series forecasting using an XGBoost model.
